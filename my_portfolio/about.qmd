i'm a third year undergrad in Computer Science.i spend most of my time tinkering, cascading my way through the tabs in the internet's winding rabbit hole, reading novels, journaling and ocassionally taking my frustration out on twitter.

currently, i am a mentee at Codess.Cafe(a pro bono mentorship for women) and sktime(a library for time series). I'm keen at improving my dsa and exploring data science and ML.

i like tech which impacts people's lives in a good way. art, history, or science entwined makes it interesting even more for me.
